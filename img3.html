  <div class="ArticleCon3"><p>The best PS4 games run the gamut from pensive, surreal experiences to action-packed epics. Whether you’re looking for immersive single-player adventures, chaotic multiplayer matchups or engaging cooperative experiences, the PS4 has a game with your tastes in mind. Of course, it’s not hard to understand why. The PlayStation 4 has been out for seven years, and during that time, it’s built up a library containing thousands of games. Not only that, but Sony has led the way in exclusive titles, so the PS4 is the only way to experience new classics like God of War (2018), Spider-Man and Bloodborne. <br><br>

Of course, the PS4 can’t last forever, and the PS5 is already here to replace it. Don’t worry, though; thanks to widespread backwards compatibility, the vast majority of PS4 titles are playable on Sony’s new console. Whether you want to play these games now or save them until later, you’ll have the tech to do so. <br><br>

Read on to learn about the best PS4 games, and see which ones you think you’d enjoy. <br><br><br>
<mark>What are the best PS4 games? </mark> <br><br>
As with any other platform, it’s very hard to quantify the best PS4 games. One man’s masterpiece is another man’s clunker. Even so, it’s possible to make some broad recommendations, based on the types of games that players generally enjoy. <br><br>

For action-adventure games, it’s hard to beat God of War (2018), which casts players as Greek demigod Kratos on an exciting quest through the mystical Norselands. Not only is the gameplay tight and replete with customization options, but the story is legitimately heartfelt and touching. This one is an easy recommendation, particularly if you’ve played the rest of the God of War series up until this point.<br> <br>

Superhero fans need to check out Spider-Man, which is one of the absolute best adaptations of the classic Marvel comic. Unlike some of the recent movies, Spider-Man on PS4 emphasizes Peter Parker’s New York roots and his interesting supporting cast. From Otto Octavius to Mary Jane Watson to Aunt May, Spider-Man’s story is full of three-dimensional renditions of the characters we’ve come to love from the printed page.<br> <br>

The Ratchet & Clank series has always offered some of the best platformers around, and Ratchet & Clank (2016) is no exception. This game is a reboot that ties into the thoroughly disappointing animated film, but don’t worry; the video game adaptation got the better part of this deal. Ratchet & Clank features tough platforming, satisfying combat and a story that will have both kids and adults in peals of laughter.<br> <br>

The best PS4 games also include multiplatform titles to enjoy, from RPGs like The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, to fighting games like Mortal Kombat 11. <br> <br>

Alternatively, if you're looking for multiplayer titles, check out the best split screen PS4 games. Or, if you don't want to spend any cash, you can grab one of the best free PS4 games. And if you need more storage space for all these new games, you can invest in one of the best external hard drives for PS4 and Xbox One.<br> <br>

<div class="game1">  <mark>1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla</mark>  Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the latest entry in Ubisoft's long-running action/stealth series, and it's another solid one. This time, you'll take control of Eivor: a Viking warrior in medieval England,who must establish a new home for his clan. You'll explore a variety of warring kingdoms, assassinate key targets, do battle against dangerous Saxons and even participate in Viking rap battles known as "flyting."

While Assassin's Creed Valhalla looks and plays wonderfully on the PS4, your copy will also entitle you to a PS5 version, which has better lighting, richer HDR colors and a smoother frame rate. Your save data will carry over, too, but be warned that transferring achievements can be a little wonky. <br><br>

</div>

<div class="game2">  <mark>2.God Of War:</mark> After a five-year hiatus, the God of War series is back, and it's very different. Kratos, formerly a living ball of rage, is now a family man, trying to balance his deicidal past with his devotion to his adolescent son, Atreus. Leaving Greece behind, Kratos now occupies Scandinavia — and that means, among other things, that there's a whole new host of mythical beasts to slay. From trolls and ogres, to undead horrors and even Norse gods, Kratos’s new enemies put his skills to the test constantly.

While the story questions whether Kratos' violent past was fully justified, the gameplay is as satisfying and visceral as ever, pitting the demigod against all manner of trolls, sea monsters and dragons. It's a bold new direction for a beloved series, and easily one of the best PS4 games you can buy.

</div>
<div class="game3"> <mark>3.Horizon Zero Dawn</mark> : has it all: an interesting open world, a creative story, a relatable protagonist, a variety of challenges and, of course, a whole host of gigantic robot dinosaurs. You’ll be able to topple these massive beasts, as well as a variety of human enemies, with a bow and arrow and plenty of other melee and ranged weapons.

Set in a postapocalyptic world that has had time to become lush once again, Horizon Zero Dawn tells the story of Aloy: a pariah from her tribe, who nevertheless becomes a master of the bow and spear. As she explores the dangerous world around her, she learns that she may play a pivotal role in changing it for the better. It's one of the best PS4 games that's exclusive to the system, although it's now available to play on PC as well.

</div>
<div class="game4"> <mark>The Last of Us</mark>, Part II is an ambitious sequel to a beloved game. As such, it was always going to be divisive — and that's probably just what the developers intended. In this post-apocalyptic action/adventure game, you take control of Ellie, who embarks on an epic quest for revenge across the remnants of the western United States. Grown up and elevated from "sidekick" to "protagonist" status, Ellie has to rely on her own skills and decide when (or if) revenge slips past "necessity" and into "obsession."

The story in The Last of Us 2 has quite a few interesting twists and turns, but the gameplay supports it beautifully. With lots of ways to customize and upgrade Ellie, and a bevy of options for stealth, combat and exploration, The Last of Us 2 makes use of big, creative levels and intelligent enemies of both the human and Infected varieties. With gorgeous graphics and moving voice acting, it's not hard to see why The Last of Us 2 is one of the best PS4 games you can buy.

</div>
<div class="game5">   <mark>Uncharted 4</mark>  In Nathan Drake's final adventure, he pursues pirate treasure, evades a ruthless villain and throws his personal life into chaos — and that's just the setup. Uncharted 4 is the last, and arguably the best, game in the Uncharted series, combining a delightful historical mystery with top-notch gunplay and vehicular exploration sections. Not only will you engage in some of the toughest firefights in the series, but you’ll also check out beautiful African vistas, track down hidden artifacts and puzzle out some intricate brainteasers.

If you haven't already played the first three games, Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is also worthwhile. All told, The Uncharted saga comprises some of the best PS4 games you can get exclusively on the system.

</div>
<div class="game6"> <mark>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</mark> Toss a coin to your Witcher, O valley of plenty! If you've been marathoning The Witcher on Netflix, then you owe it to yourself to check out the excellent games as well. While the first two Witcher titles aren't available on PS4, you can play the biggest and arguably best of the bunch: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. (But seriously, if you have a gaming PC, the first two titles are well worth your time.)

This game takes place many years after Geralt's adventures in the show. Nilfgaard is waging another war on the Northern Realms, and only Geralt can stop the threat — if he can track down his wayward ward, Ciri, first. With a huge world, tight gameplay and plenty of opportunities to shape the story, The Witcher 3 is one of the very best games of the last decade.
